This Python program for converting images to WebP format has the following features:

    Image Conversion: The program allows users to convert an input image to the WebP format.

    Custom Output Path: Users can specify the desired path for the output WebP image.

    Compression Quality Control: Users can control the compression quality of the WebP image by entering a quality value (0-100). A lower quality value results in higher compression and potentially smaller file size, but with a trade-off in image quality.

    Automatic .webp Extension: The program automatically appends the ".webp" extension to the output file path if not provided by the user.

Extensions:

    JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
    PNG (.png)
    GIF (.gif)
    BMP (.bmp)
    TIFF (.tiff, .tif)
    ICO (.ico)
    WebP (.webp) - Tool supports WebP as both input and output.
